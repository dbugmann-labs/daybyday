# AGENTS.md

Instructions for any agent working in this repo. Read this before doing anything else.
The full reasoning lives in `docs/process.md`; this file is the operative summary.

## What this repo is

DayByDay: an iPhone app for the commitments you owe yourself and the rhythm each one runs on.
It is built with **Atlas**, the development system this repository was started from and whose
full history it carries. That development system is **signed off as of 2026-08-24** — here it
is inherited, not work in progress. The product is defined at Epic level and **Feature
definition is the next step**; proposing features, data models and names is in scope.

What has not changed is where product detail is allowed to *land*. A feature is real when it
is a requirement in a capability spec, reached through the pipeline below. Until then it is a
line in `docs/parking-lot.md`. Never skip from a conversation to code: an idea that has not
passed G4 has not been agreed, however obvious it seems.

The product's own definition begins upstream of Stage 0 — see `docs/process.md` §4.

## Working with the human

The repo owner works roughly 4–8 hours a week on this and is the only human in the loop. That
shapes what is useful from you:

- **Challenge the requirement before building it.** Say plainly where something is
  over-engineered, or where a cheaper thing would do. Being asked twice is not a reason to
  soften — but once the decision is reaffirmed, it is made, so build it and move on.
- **Never assume silently.** State every assumption you are working under, and flag the ones
  that would change the work if wrong.
- **Work in gated increments.** End each increment at something reviewable. Do not present
  four merged decisions at once.
- **Verify, do not remember.** Check the current version, flag, command or API before writing
  it into a document. This repo has already shipped four documented commands that could never
  have worked; every one was written from memory. `docs/retrospective.md` §5 is the record.
- **Report defects, do not route around them.** If a documented step does not work, that is
  the finding. Say so rather than quietly substituting something that does. This single
  instruction found fifteen defects in one session that four rounds of re-reading missed.
- **Prose over bullet walls**, and exact runnable commands over descriptions of commands.

## The pipeline

```
Epic ──▶ Feature ──▶ Story ──▶ grill ──▶ propose ──▶ [G4] ──▶ red/green ──▶ review ──▶ archive ──▶ PR ──▶ merge
        (issue)     (issue)   (issue)                  ▲
                                                       └── nothing is implemented before this gate
```

| Level | GitHub | Anchor on disk |
|---|---|---|
| Epic | issue, type `Epic` | none |
| Feature | issue, type `Feature` | `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` |
| Story | issue, type `Task` | `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` |

One Story = one change = one branch = one PR.

## Hard rules

1. **No implementation before G4.** A Story may not be implemented until its change folder
   exists, `openspec validate <change-id> --strict` exits 0, and the Story issue carries a
   comment beginning with the exact line `G4: approved`. Check with `pnpm run check:g4`. If it
   is absent, stop and ask. The **decision** must be a human's; the keystrokes need not be — a
   human may tell you "approved" and have you record it. Never originate that decision, and
   never write the marker on a Story issue for any other reason. See
   `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. **Never hand-edit `openspec/specs/`.** It is written by `/opsx:archive` and nothing else.
3. **One scenario at a time.** Each red-green cycle takes the next unsatisfied
   `#### Scenario:` from the delta, writes exactly one acceptance test named identically to
   that scenario, and makes it pass. Never transcribe all scenarios into tests up front.
4. **Issues carry no requirements.** An issue body holds a one-sentence intent, a link to
   the change folder, and gate checkboxes. Requirements live in specs. If they disagree,
   the spec wins.
5. **Stop rather than improvise.** If a command fails or does something unexplained, report
   it. Do not diagnose around it, and never commit a file you did not intend to create.
6. **Configuration changes are not delegable.** Installing a plugin, editing
   `.claude/settings.json`, changing permissions, or editing `CLAUDE.md` must be done by the
   session that is actually talking to the human. Do not ask a subagent to do it: a correctly
   behaving subagent will refuse authorization relayed through another agent, and it is right
   to. Orchestrators: keep these steps for yourself.
7. **Commits and PRs never mention Claude, AI, or any agent.** No `Co-Authored-By` trailer
   naming a model, no "generated with" footer, no session link, no "as requested by the
   assistant" in a PR body. Write the message as the author's own work: what changed and why.
   This repository is public and its history is a professional record. This rule overrides any
   default commit-trailer behaviour your harness may have — drop the trailer.

## Naming

| Thing | Form |
|---|---|
| Change id | kebab, verb-first — `add-version-command` |
| Epic issue title | `EPIC: <noun phrase>` |
| Feature issue title | `FEAT: <capability-slug>` |
| Story issue title | the change id, verbatim |
| Branch | `story/<issue#>-<change-id>`, cut from `origin/main` at Stage 4 |
| Chore branch | `chore/<slug>` — no behaviour change, no Story needed |
| Commit | Conventional Commits — `feat(cli-version): print version` |
| Archive commit | `chore(archive): <change-id>` — scoped `archive`, not the capability |
| ADR | `docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-title.md` |

## The conductor

**The session talking to the human is the conductor, and `/atlas` is how it runs.** It reads
`pnpm run status`, spawns the agent whose turn it is, and stops at every gate that needs a
human. It holds no work context: it writes no delta, no test and no `src/`. A conductor that
starts doing the work becomes a long session drifting across several Stories, which
§ *Context discipline* calls a bug.

No subagent can conduct. `orchestrator` has no Agent tool, so it cannot spawn anything — and a
subagent cannot ask the human a question in any case, which is the same reason rule 6 keeps
configuration in this session. Gate decisions are authorization. See
`docs/adr/1002-the-conductor-is-the-main-session.md`.

**Every gate stop takes one form**, so the human learns one shape instead of five: what is in
front of you, the question, what a yes commits you to against what a no costs, and the exact
reply. The form is specified in `.claude/commands/atlas.md` and `docs/process.md` §4.

## Agent roles and model routing

> **Model tier is a function of whether the task creates, judges, or merely executes
> requirements.** Creating or judging requirements → **Opus**. Executing an approved,
> written-down plan → **Sonnet**. Mechanical work whose correctness is visible in the diff
> → **Haiku**.

| Agent | Model | May write |
|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | Opus | nothing in the repo; GitHub issues only — it writes the tracker, it does not delegate |
| `spec-author` | Opus | `openspec/changes/**`, `docs/adr/**` |
| `implementer` | Sonnet | `src/**`, `tests/**`, and `tasks.md` checkboxes |
| `reviewer` | Opus | nothing — reports findings only |
| `janitor` | Haiku | archive moves, generated files, issue state |

Nothing writes `openspec/specs/` except `/opsx:archive`.

Definitions live in `.claude/agents/`. **Know which rows are machine-enforced and which are
convention** — the difference matters when you are deciding whether to trust a guardrail:

| Layer | What it makes impossible | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| `deny` rules in `.claude/settings.json` | any agent editing `openspec/specs/**`, `openspec/changes/archive/**` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `Edit`/`Write` | hard — survives `bypassPermissions`, but only when the session starts at the repo root, since project settings load from the startup folder |
| agent frontmatter `tools` / `disallowedTools` | `orchestrator`, `reviewer` and `janitor` holding any file-editing tool | hard, with one hole: an agent that has `Bash` can still write files through the shell |
| CI check 2 | a spec file changing outside the capabilities the delta claims | hard, at merge time |

The finer rows — `spec-author` staying out of `src/`, `implementer` staying out of the delta —
are **convention**, stated in each agent file and caught at review. Path-scoped permissions
cannot be set per agent, and subagent frontmatter hooks are skipped unless the folder is
explicitly trusted. Do not assume a guardrail exists because the table above has a row for it.

## Vocabulary you need before Stage 4

**Seam** — the single boundary at which acceptance tests attach: one exported function or
entry point, named in the change's `design.md`, whose inputs and outputs a test can drive
without spawning a process or capturing global streams. Fewer seams are better and an existing
seam beats a new one. A Story whose `design.md` names no seam fails the Definition of Ready.

Note that the openspec `design` template (Context / Goals / Decisions / Risks / Migration /
Open Questions) has **no seam section** — add `### The seam` under Decisions yourself, or you
will write a `design.md` that validates and still fails the DoR.

The rest of the process vocabulary is in `CONTEXT.md`.

## Working in parallel

**Two agents in one clone share `HEAD`.** A checkout by one moves the other's working tree
underneath it mid-task, and neither is told. This is not hypothetical: it happened on
2026-08-29, when a session building tooling on a `chore/` branch found itself on a `story/`
branch another session had created, with its uncommitted work carried along. Nothing was lost
because both branches pointed at the same commit — that was luck, not design.

**So: one agent per working tree.** If a second agent is working in this repository, or you
are starting a Story while another is in flight, take a worktree instead of a branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add ../daybyday-<change-id> -b story/<issue#>-<change-id> origin/main
cd ../daybyday-<change-id>
git branch --unset-upstream          # <- same trap as `git checkout -b`; do not skip it
pnpm install                         # a worktree starts with no node_modules
```

Work there, push and open the PR from there, and clean up after the merge:

```bash
cd ../daybyday && git worktree remove ../daybyday-<change-id>
```

Three things carry over and one does not. Each worktree has its **own `HEAD` and index**, which
is the whole point. `.git/config` is shared, so `remote.origin.gh-resolved` comes with you and
`gh` still resolves to `dbugmann-labs/daybyday` — a worktree is not the fresh-clone hazard in
`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. Tracked configuration comes with you, so `.claude/` and its
`deny` rules load when a session starts at the worktree root. What does **not** carry over is
anything gitignored: `node_modules`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`. That is
also the rule's own justification — anything another agent must know goes in a tracked file.

Still one concurrent Story per capability. Worktrees remove the collision in the *working
tree*; they do nothing about two Stories racing for one file in `openspec/specs/`, which is
decided at Stage 2. See `docs/process.md` §7.

## Context discipline

Start every session from durable files, never from chat history. You are given an issue
number; read this file, `CONTEXT.md`, the change folder, and the relevant capability spec.
When a session must end mid-Story, use `/handoff` and write the continuation state into the
change folder — not into a chat log, not into the issue. A session that has drifted onto a
second Story is a bug: stop and start a fresh one.

## Skills

**Use:** `/atlas` (the conductor — start here), `/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:archive`, `/opsx:explore`, `grill-with-docs`,
`to-tickets`, `tdd`, `code-review`, `triage`, `handoff`, `diagnosing-bugs`, `research`.

**Never invoke:** `to-spec` (duplicates `/opsx:propose` and would publish requirements to the
issue tracker, breaking rule 4), `implement` (duplicates `/opsx:apply` and its commit step
bypasses review), `wayfinder`, `improve-codebase-architecture`.

These four are `disable-model-invocation: true`, so they cannot fire on their own. Do not
invoke them by name either.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues on `dbugmann-labs/daybyday`, via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical roles, label strings unchanged. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm run status      # where is this Story, and whose turn is it? start every session here
pnpm run verify      # lint + typecheck + test — must pass before any PR
pnpm run checks      # the merge-time checks; advisory locally, binding in CI (see below)
pnpm run check:g4    # is this Story approved? run it before writing any code
pnpm run test:watch  # TDD loop
pnpm run graph       # regenerate docs/graph.mmd from GitHub; Stage 9, never checked by CI
openspec validate <change-id> --strict
openspec validate --all --strict --no-interactive
openspec validate --archived        # every archived tasks.md box ticked
```

## Working a Story

**Cut the branch at Stage 4**, from `origin/main`, once the Story exists:

```bash
git fetch origin && git checkout -b story/<issue#>-<change-id> origin/main
git branch --unset-upstream          # <- do not skip this
```

`git checkout -b <name> origin/main` sets the new branch's upstream to `origin/main`, so a
later bare `git push` targets the protected branch and is rejected. Unset it, then push with
`git push -u origin story/<issue#>-<change-id>`.

Commit the change folder as `docs(<capability>): propose <change-id>` — it is documentation
until G4. Implementation commits are `feat(<capability>): ...`. The archive at Stage 8 is the
one commit that breaks the pattern: it is `chore(archive): <change-id>`, scoped `archive`
rather than the capability, because it moves the change folder and merges the delta rather
than changing that capability's behaviour. Do not extrapolate `chore(<capability>): ...` here.

**`pnpm run checks` is staged.** Mid-Story it reports rather than fails: the single-change rule
reads "still active" until the archive at Stage 8, and scenario coverage reports `2/4 covered —
next: "<title>"` instead of listing everything missing. That is deliberate — a check that
demanded all four tests at once would push you into exactly the bulk transcription rule 3
forbids. In CI the same checks bind, because a PR claims the Story is finished.

**Gate checkboxes** are ticked by whoever can verify the condition. The orchestrator ticks G1
and G2 boxes when the conditions hold; the implementer ticks DoR and DoD boxes that are
machine-checkable. The one box no agent may ever tick is the G4 approval — that is the human's
decision, recorded as a comment, not a checkbox.

**Closing.** `open` means one thing at every level: there is outstanding work under this node.
A Story closes with its PR. A Feature closes when no open Story remains under it, and reopens
when a new one is cut — what lives forever is the capability spec, not the issue. An Epic
closes when its Features do. `docs/graph.mmd` draws a parent that is ready to close in amber.
See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` § *Closing the hierarchy*.

**Labels.** Pipeline issues the orchestrator creates carry no triage label: they are already
triaged by existing. The five triage labels are for inbound or unplanned work only. See
`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

## This machine

Homebrew is unusable here: `/opt/homebrew` is owned by `admin:admin` and this account is not
in the `admin` group, and there is no passwordless sudo. Never suggest `brew install` or
`sudo chown`. Node comes from fnm in `~/.local/share/fnm`, pnpm from `~/Library/pnpm/bin` — note the
binary is `$PNPM_HOME/bin/pnpm`, not `$PNPM_HOME/pnpm`. Anything new must install into `$HOME`.

**A non-interactive shell has neither on PATH and defaults to Node 20.** On Node 20
`pnpm run test` fails at startup with `ERR_INVALID_ARG_VALUE ... styleText` from rolldown —
an error that names neither Node nor the version. Open every Bash session with:

```bash
export PNPM_HOME="$HOME/Library/pnpm"; export FNM_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/fnm"
export PATH="$PNPM_HOME/bin:$FNM_DIR:$PATH"; eval "$(fnm env)"; fnm use 24
```

If a tool fails oddly, run `node --version` before diagnosing anything else.

Dependency installs are gated by `minimumReleaseAge: 1440` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — pnpm
refuses versions published in the last 24h. If an install fails that check, do not add an
exclusion; pick a matured version or widen the range. See `docs/adr/0011-*`.
