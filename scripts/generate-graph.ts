/**
 * Regenerates `docs/graph.mmd` — a read-only projection of the Epic → Feature → Story
 * hierarchy held in GitHub Issues (docs/adr/0002-systems-of-record.md, ADR-0012).
 *
 * The graph is a projection and never an input. Nothing reads it back; editing it by hand
 * changes nothing and is overwritten on the next run. It exists so a human can see the shape
 * of the tracker without clicking through it.
 *
 * **Source: the GraphQL API, not `gh issue list --json`.** That command exposes neither the
 * issue type nor the sub-issue edge (checked against gh 2.83.0), so it cannot produce this
 * file. One GraphQL query returns both, excludes pull requests, and costs a single request.
 *
 * **Deliberately not a CI check.** Issue state changes without any commit, so a staleness
 * check would redden `main` whenever somebody opened an issue. `.github/workflows/graph.yml`
 * runs this on every `issues` activity instead and pushes the result straight to `main`, so
 * nobody has to remember to. Its output is deterministic and carries no timestamp, which is
 * what lets that workflow decide whether to commit by asking git for an empty diff.
