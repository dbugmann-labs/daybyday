# CONTEXT

The project's shared vocabulary. Agents read this so that spec wording, test names and issue
titles all use the same words for the same things.

This file is maintained by the `grill-with-docs` skill as domain understanding develops.
Add a term when you catch yourself explaining it twice.

## Status

**Product definition began 2026-08-24**, when the development system was signed off. The first
domain terms were agreed on 2026-08-28 with `EPIC: Daily commitments` (#1) and are below.
Terms are added as they are agreed, one term per thing, the moment you catch yourself
explaining it twice.

## Process vocabulary

**Epic** — a body of work spanning several capabilities. A GitHub issue of type `Epic`. Has
no anchor on disk; pure coordination.

**Feature** — one capability. A GitHub issue of type `Feature`, corresponding one-to-one with
`openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`. The **spec** lives forever; the **issue** closes when no
open Story remains under it and reopens when a new one is cut, so that `open` keeps one meaning
across all three levels. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` § *Closing the hierarchy*.

**Story** — one unit of implementable work. A GitHub issue of type `Task`, corresponding
one-to-one with an OpenSpec change, a branch and a pull request. Archived when done.

**Change** — OpenSpec's unit of work: the folder `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` holding a
proposal, delta specs, a design and a task list. One change is one Story.

**Delta spec** — the part of a change describing only what is changing, as `ADDED`,
`MODIFIED` or `REMOVED` requirements, rather than restating a whole spec.

**Capability** — a domain grouping of behaviour, one directory under `openspec/specs/`.

**Scenario** — a concrete Given/When/Then example proving a requirement. Each one maps to
exactly one acceptance test of the same name. See `docs/adr/0005-scenarios-drive-tests.md`.

**Seam** — the public boundary a test observes behaviour at. Named in a change's `design.md`
before any test is written.

**G4** — the spec-approval gate. Nothing is implemented before it. See `docs/process.md`.

## Domain vocabulary

**Commitment** — something you have decided you owe yourself on a recurring rhythm: the gym,
the monthly finances, watering the plants. It is defined once and recurs indefinitely. It is
deliberately not a *task*, which is completed once and then gone; not a *habit*, which fits
supplements but not finances; and not an *area*, a word tried first and dropped because it was
covering three unlike behaviours at once.

**Schedule** — the rule attached to a commitment that decides which days it is due on. Four
shapes are known to be needed: a set of weekdays, every N days, a day of the month, and N
times within a week on any days.

**Due** — a commitment is due on a day when that day's date satisfies its schedule. Whether a
commitment is due is a question asked *of a date*, not of the present moment.

**Tick** — to record that a due commitment was done. The past is writable: a day other than
today can be ticked.

**Day** — the unit the product is organised around. The landing screen is one day, and every
record is keyed to a date rather than to the time it was entered.

**Calendar date** — a year, a month of that year and a day of that month: the argument every
due-ness question is asked about. It carries no clock, no time zone and no locale, and a
combination that names no day — 30 February — is not one. Its year runs from 1583 to 9999
inclusive: earlier than that the calendar a weekday comes from is the Julian one, so the date has
no Gregorian weekday to give. Deliberately not an instant; see
`docs/adr/1003-the-rule-engine-speaks-calendar-dates.md`.

**Weekday set** — the first of the four schedule shapes: the days of the week a commitment runs
on, as a set. "Gym Mon/Wed/Sat" is one. Membership is the whole rule, so a set of all seven is
due every day and an empty set is due on none.

**Rule engine** — the pure logic that answers whether a commitment is due, with no UI and no
storage under it. It lives in the `DayByDayKit` Swift package and is driven from the terminal by
`swift test`.
