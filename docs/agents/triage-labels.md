# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This repo uses the same strings, so
the mapping is the identity — when a skill mentions a role, use the label of that name.

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `needs-triage` | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue |
| `needs-info` | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent` | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent |
| `ready-for-human` | Requires human implementation |
| `wontfix` | Will not be actioned |

## Which issues carry these

**Not pipeline issues.** An Epic, Feature or Story the orchestrator creates is already triaged
by existing: it was decomposed deliberately and is being driven. Applying `needs-triage` to it
is noise, and the issue templates apply no label for that reason.

These five labels are for **inbound or unplanned work** — something noticed mid-Story, a bug
report, an idea that arrives before it has an Epic. `needs-triage` is where such an issue
starts; it leaves by becoming a Story under a Feature, or by `wontfix`.
