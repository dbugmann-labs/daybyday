# Atlas — Process Architecture

**Status:** in force. Scaffolding signed off 2026-08-24; run end to end once, by `add-version-command`.
**Audience:** any agent or human picking up any issue in this repo, with zero prior context
**See also:** `README.md` to get started, `docs/retrospective.md` for what this actually cost

## 0. The whole process in one paragraph

Work is decomposed into **Epics** (coordination only), **Features** (each one a capability spec that lives forever), and **Stories** (each one an OpenSpec change, one branch, one PR, then archived). Nothing is implemented until its change folder exists, validates, and has been approved by a human — that is the one hard gate. After approval, an implementer works the change's scenarios one at a time, red-green, until every scenario in the delta has a passing acceptance test of the same name. The pull request opens as a draft the moment the spec is written, so both human gates are read as a diff rather than as a folder. The change is then archived as the final commit on the same branch, so one PR carries the spec, the code and the merge into the source of truth — and CI refuses any spec edit that the archived delta does not claim. The repo is authoritative for *content*; GitHub is authoritative for *state and order*; nothing is written down twice.

If you can say that paragraph from memory, you know the process.

---

## 1. Systems of record

Three systems overlap. Each is authoritative for exactly one thing, and nothing is authoritative twice.

| Question | Authoritative artifact | Lives in | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|---|
| What does the system do today? | `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` | repo | forever |
| What will this change do to that? | `openspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/**` (delta) | repo | until archive |
| Why did we choose this? | `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` | repo | forever |
| What do our words mean? | `CONTEXT.md` | repo | forever |
| What is being worked on, in what order, blocked by what? | GitHub Issues | GitHub | until closed |
| What steps remain inside this change? | `openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md` | repo | until archive |

**The rule: the repo owns content, GitHub owns state.** An issue body never contains requirements, acceptance criteria, or design. It contains a one-sentence intent, a link to the change folder, and checkboxes for the process gates. If an issue and a spec disagree, the spec wins and the issue is wrong.

This is what removes double bookkeeping. `to-tickets` normally writes acceptance criteria into issue bodies; here it does not — its issue template is overridden in `AGENTS.md` to emit stubs.

**Traceability** is one-way and write-once. The Story issue is created by the agent at Stage 2 via `gh api --method POST .../issues` — not `gh issue create`, which cannot set an issue type — titled with the change-id. The branch name embeds both the issue number and the change-id. The PR closes the issue. Nothing syncs back. The dependency graph (`docs/graph.mmd`) is *regenerated read-only* by `pnpm run graph` on demand — it is a projection, never an input. That generator reads the GraphQL API, because `gh issue list --json` exposes neither the issue type nor the sub-issue edge and so cannot produce the file. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

`pnpm run status` is the second projection and follows the same rule. It derives a Story's stage from the branch, the change folder, `openspec validate`, the G4 comment, the scenario coverage, the `tasks.md` boxes and the pull request — whether it exists, whether it is still a draft, and how far `main` has moved past it — and says whose turn it is. It is read-only, derived on demand, and consumed by no check — deleting it would cost information, not correctness. If it disagrees with the change folder or the tracker, status is what is wrong. See ADR-1002.

> Rejected alternative: a bidirectional sync script. It is the highest-maintenance component in any setup like this and it fails silently. Write-once creation plus a read-only projection gets ~90% of the value with none of the drift.

## 2. Repository layout

One repo. Specs live beside the code they describe, which is OpenSpec's core premise and also the only way a cold agent handed one URL can follow this process.

## 3. Decomposition and its mapping to OpenSpec

OpenSpec has exactly one unit of work — the *change* — and no hierarchy at all. It fixes the bottom of our hierarchy and anchors the middle. Everything above is GitHub's job.

| Level | GitHub | Anchor on disk | Cardinality | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Epic** | issue, type `Epic` | none — pure coordination | 1 Epic : many Features | weeks–months |
| **Feature** | issue, type `Feature` | `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` | 1 Feature : 1 capability | the spec forever; the issue closes and reopens |
| **Story** | issue, type `Task` | `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` | 1 Story : 1 change : 1 branch : 1 PR | days |

The middle level is honest because a Feature *is* a capability spec. It is not a ceremony layer; it is a file.

**Sizing rule for a Story**, inherited from OpenSpec: one intent you can state in a sentence, buildable in one focused session. If describing it needs "and also", split it. If reviewing it would take an afternoon, split it.

**Edge cases.** A Story that touches more than one capability hangs off the Feature it primarily advances; the additional capabilities are named in `proposal.md`. A Feature belongs to exactly one Epic, so sub-issues stay a tree rather than a graph. Work with no behaviour change — tooling, refactors, docs — skips the Feature level entirely and uses the `chore/` escape hatch in §5.

### Naming conventions

| Thing | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Epic issue title | `EPIC: <noun phrase>` | `EPIC: Development system` |
| Feature issue title | `FEAT: <capability-slug>` | `FEAT: cli-version` |
| Capability directory | kebab noun | `openspec/specs/cli-version/` |
| Story issue title | the change-id, verbatim | `add-version-command` |
| Change id | kebab, verb-first | `add-version-command` |
| Branch | `story/<issue#>-<change-id>` | `story/14-add-version-command` |
| Chore branch | `chore/<slug>` | `chore/bump-node-22` |
| Archive commit | `chore(archive): <change-id>` | last commit on the story branch |
| Archive branch | only if §7's switch-back trigger fires | `archive/add-version-command` |
| Commit | Conventional Commits | `feat(cli-version): print version from package.json` |
| PR title | = the squash commit message | same |
| ADR | `docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-title.md` | `docs/adr/0004-branch-isolation-and-archive.md` |
| Archive folder | OpenSpec-controlled | `openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-21-add-version-command/` |

## 4. The lifecycle

### Before Stage 0: where the product comes from

**This lifecycle assumes you already know what you are building.** Stage 0 is *Epic intake* — it receives a body of work, it does not discover one. Product definition sits upstream of it and is deliberately not a numbered stage, because it is a conversation with the human rather than a pipeline with gates.

It has one rule and one artifact. The rule: **an idea is not agreed until it has passed G4 as a requirement in a change folder.** Everything before that is a candidate, however confident anyone sounds. The artifact is `docs/parking-lot.md`, the holding pen between "someone said it" and "it is agreed" — entries land there in one line, and leave in exactly one direction, by being promoted into an Epic or Feature issue and deleted.

Promotion deletes an entry only when the issue can actually carry it. Issues hold no requirements (rule 4), so an Epic absorbs a one-line idea but not concrete detail — the eight commitments and their rhythms that produced `EPIC: Daily commitments`, for instance. Detail like that stays parked until a change folder exists to receive it, and is deleted when the spec that supersedes it is archived. An entry outliving its Epic is expected; an entry outliving the spec that covers it is stale.

`/opsx:explore` and `/grill-with-docs` are the tools for this phase; new domain terms land in `CONTEXT.md` as they are agreed. It ends when there is a body of work you can name in a sentence and a human who agrees that is the next thing to build. That is a Stage 0 Epic.

### Who drives

**The session talking to the human is the conductor**, and `/atlas` is how it runs. It reads `pnpm run status`, spawns the agent whose turn it is, stops at every gate that needs a human, and holds no work context of its own — no delta, no test, no `src/`. No subagent can do this job: `orchestrator` has no Agent tool, and a subagent cannot ask the human a question in any case, which is the same reason hard rule 6 keeps configuration in the human-facing session. Gate decisions are authorization. ADR-1002 records the reasoning, including the fact that the orchestrator was documented for months as delegating work it was never able to delegate.

The intended rhythm is **four interruptions per Story** — G1, G2, G4, G7 — and unattended running between them. `/atlas feature <idea>` starts at the top: it grills the idea, stops at G1, and carries it down to G4 without further prompting.

### The stages

Ten stages, five gates. **Gate** means work stops until a named condition holds. `H` = you sign off, `CI` = machine-checked, `A` = agent-internal.

**Every stage is entered by the conductor** — the session running `/atlas`, which reads `pnpm run status` and spawns the agent in the *Runs where* column. The conductor executes no stage itself. *Who decides* is the column that matters when you are asking whether you can walk away: `you` means the pipeline stops until you answer.

| # | Stage | Who decides | Runs where | Output | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Epic intake | **you** | `orchestrator` / Opus | Epic issue | — |
| 1 | Feature definition | **you** | `orchestrator` / Opus | Feature issue, sub-issue of Epic | **G1 (H)** |
| 2 | Story decomposition | **you** accept; `/to-tickets` proposes | `orchestrator` / Opus | Story issues, sub-issues of Feature, blocking edges declared | **G2 (H)** |
| 3 | Grill | agent, but **you** answer what it cannot | `spec-author` / Opus, via `/grill-with-docs` | `design.md` **Open Questions** filled in — "None" is a valid and required answer — plus any new `CONTEXT.md` terms | — |
| 4 | Propose | agent writes; **you** approve | `spec-author` / Opus, via `/opsx:propose` | change folder: proposal, delta specs, design, tasks — cut the branch or worktree here, commit as `docs(<capability>): propose <change-id>`, push, and open the **draft PR** | **G4 (H+CI)** ← the hard gate |
| 5 | Red | agent | `implementer` / Sonnet, via `/tdd` | one failing acceptance test | A |
| 6 | Green + next | agent | `implementer` / Sonnet, via `/opsx:apply` | one scenario per cycle until the delta is satisfied, pushed to the same PR as it goes | A |
| 7 | Review | agent reports; **you** judge | `reviewer` / Opus, via `/code-review` | the PR rebased onto current `main`; findings, two-axis: standards + spec fidelity | **G7 (H)** |
| 8 | Archive | agent | `janitor` / Haiku, via `/opsx:archive` | delta merged into `openspec/specs/`, change moved to `changes/archive/`, PR taken out of draft with `gh pr ready` | — |
| 9 | Merge | agent | `janitor` / Haiku | issue auto-closed, parents settled, `docs/graph.mmd` regenerated | **G8 (CI)** |

Read the bold entries down the *Who decides* column and you have your whole obligation: four stops — G1, G2, G4, G7 — plus answering whatever the grill cannot settle on its own. Stages 5, 6, 8 and 9 never wait for you.

### The gates, precisely

**G1 — Feature ready.** The Feature names one capability, the capability slug is decided, and the Feature is a sub-issue of exactly one Epic.

**G2 — Decomposition accepted.** Every Story states one sentence of intent. Blocking edges are declared and acyclic. You have said yes to the breakdown; `to-tickets` iterates until you do.

**G4 — Spec approved. This is the gate your whole requirement set rests on.** All of:
- `openspec validate <change-id> --strict` exits 0
- the delta uses ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED correctly against current specs
- every requirement has at least one scenario, and the error/edge cases have scenarios, not just the happy path
- a **draft pull request** is open on the branch and rebased onto current `main`
- you have read `proposal.md` and the delta, and the Story issue carries a comment beginning `G4: approved`

No implementation commit may precede that comment. Enforcement is CI check 5 in §7.

The **decision** must be a human's; the keystrokes need not be. A human may say "approved" and have an agent record it. The marker is the exact line `G4: approved`, not the bare word, because "approved" occurs constantly in ordinary prose and an agent writing *"waiting on the approved comment"* would otherwise forge the gate for any grep-based reader.

**G7 — Review clean.** `code-review` reports no unresolved findings on either axis. The reviewer never edits code; it reports and the implementer fixes. The same PR is refreshed against `main` first, so what is reviewed is what will merge.

**G8 — CI green.** The only gate between a finished Story and `main`. It now also carries what used to be a separate archive gate: `openspec validate --archived` proves every `tasks.md` box is ticked, and spec-diff containment proves the archive touched only capabilities the delta claims. See §7 for the exact check list.

Archiving happens on the story branch as the last commit, not in a follow-up PR. The review at G7 runs *before* the archive commit, so the reviewer sees the change folder at the path you approved at G4.

### The PR is the gate surface

**The pull request opens at Stage 4, as a draft, and the two human gates are read through it.** At G4 it holds one commit — the change folder — and at G7 it holds the whole Story. That is one URL, one diff view, and one place where CI's verdict is already visible next to the thing you are being asked to judge. The alternative, which this replaced, was a gate presented as a list of file paths for you to open by hand, and a PR that appeared only once everything was already built.

Three consequences follow, and all three are mechanical rather than matters of taste:

**Draft is a signal, not decoration.** A draft PR asserts the Story is *not* finished, which is the exact opposite of what four of the eight merge-time checks in §7 test — single-change, scenario coverage, G4 recorded, archive complete. Those four are skipped while the PR is a draft and bind the moment the janitor runs `gh pr ready` at Stage 8. The other four run throughout, so a draft still tells you whether the branch lints, typechecks, tests, validates and stays inside its capabilities. This is why `ready_for_review` is in the workflow's trigger list: it is not one of GitHub's default `pull_request` event types, and without it the full check list would first run on whatever push happened to come next.

**The branch is rebased onto `origin/main` before each gate**, with `git push --force-with-lease`. A rebase rather than a merge, so the PR shows the Story's own commits and nothing else. The reason is not tidiness: a delta's ADDED / MODIFIED claims are written against the specs as they stand, and `main` moving underneath the branch can invalidate them without touching a file in it. A conflict that lands inside the change folder or `openspec/specs/` is the §7 spec collision arriving late — stop and report it rather than resolving it.

**Nothing about the G4 gate itself moves.** The approval is still a human's comment on the Story issue, still the exact line `G4: approved`, still CI check 5. The PR is where you read the thing you are approving; the issue is still where the decision is recorded, because that is what check 5 reads and what a merged, deleted branch leaves behind. See `docs/adr/1003-the-pr-is-the-gate-surface.md`.

### What a gate stop looks like

Every gate is presented in the same five parts, so you learn one shape rather than five. This is not decoration: a gate whose presentation is improvised each time is a gate that quietly becomes a rubber stamp, and G4 is the one the whole requirement set rests on.

1. **What is in front of you** — the PR link, and the one or two decisions the work turns on. Named specifically enough that reading only the summary is still a real decision.
2. **The question** — one sentence, answerable yes or no.
3. **What a yes commits you to, against what a no costs.** Both, always. A gate that only states the upside is asking for assent, not for judgement.
4. **The recommendation** — which reply the conductor would choose, and the one reason. Two or three lines, never a case.
5. **The exact reply** — the word, or the runnable command.

Nothing else: no praise, no recap of the pipeline, no options you did not ask for. The form is specified for agents in `.claude/commands/atlas.md`.

**Why the recommendation is part of the form rather than a courtesy.** You work four to eight hours a week and the gate arrives after an agent has spent an hour on the thing being judged. Without a stated lean, the cheapest reply is always yes, and a gate that is cheapest to approve is a rubber stamp with extra steps. A recommendation is also falsifiable in a way a summary is not: the conductor spawned the `spec-author` whose delta is on the table, so a recommendation of "changes:" against its own subagent's output is the signal that the other recommendations were read rather than relayed. What it must never be is a prediction of what you want, or a reason to answer without opening the PR — the recommendation is an argument you can reject, not the decision.

---

## 5. Branch strategy

`main` is protected and linear. Everything reaches it by squash-merged PR.

| Branch type | May touch `openspec/specs/` | May touch `src/` | Requires a change folder |
|---|---|---|---|
| `story/<issue#>-<change-id>` | **yes — in the archive commit only, and only capabilities the delta claims** | yes | yes |
| `chore/<slug>` | **no** | yes | no — but `.openspec.yaml` sets `skip_specs: true` if a change folder exists |

The `chore/` lane is the deliberate escape hatch. Without it, a one-line dependency bump would need an Epic, and you would abandon the process within a month. Chore branches are for work with no behaviour change: tooling, dependency bumps, docs, CI. If you find yourself reaching for `chore/` to add behaviour, that is the process telling you to write a Story.

**One PR per Story, open from Stage 4 to merge.** It is created as a draft as soon as the change folder is committed, updated by every implementation push, rebased onto `origin/main` before G4 and again before G7, and taken out of draft by the janitor once the archive commit lands. A `chore/` branch opens its PR whenever it is ready to be read — there are no gates on that lane.

**Ruleset on `main`** (free org + public repo, so this costs nothing): require a pull request, require status checks to pass, require linear history, block force-push, **zero required approvals**. Required approvals are theatre when you are the only human; the status checks are the real gate.

---

## 6. Agent roles and model routing

### The routing rule, stated once

> **Model tier is a function of whether the task creates, judges, or merely executes requirements.**
> Creating or judging requirements → **Opus**. Executing an approved, written-down plan → **Sonnet**. Mechanical work whose correctness is visible in the diff → **Haiku**.

That rule is the whole policy. Everything below is its application. It is written in `AGENTS.md` and in each agent's frontmatter, not decided per session.

### Write-permission matrix

This matrix, not good intentions, is what keeps parallel agents from corrupting the specs.

| Agent | Model | `openspec/specs/` | `openspec/changes/` | `src/` + `tests/` | `docs/adr/` | GitHub |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | Opus | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | create/label/link |
| `spec-author` | Opus | ✗ | **write** | ✗ | **write** | comment |
| `implementer` | Sonnet | ✗ | `tasks.md` only | **write** | ✗ | comment |
| `reviewer` | Opus | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | comment |
| `janitor` | Haiku | via `/opsx:archive` only | move to `archive/` | ✗ | ✗ | close/update |

`CONTEXT.md` is written by `spec-author` alone, at Stage 3, and by nobody else — it is the one shared file outside `openspec/` that the matrix governs.

Read as: **only `spec-author` writes deltas; nothing writes `openspec/specs/` except the archive step.**

**How much of this is actually enforced.** Two rows are mechanical and the rest are not, and
the difference is worth knowing precisely. `deny` rules in `.claude/settings.json` make
`openspec/specs/**` unwritable by `Edit`/`Write` for every agent in every permission mode —
verified against `bypassPermissions` — while leaving `/opsx:archive` free, because it writes
through the openspec CLI over Bash. Frontmatter `disallowedTools` removes file-editing tools
from `orchestrator`, `reviewer` and `janitor` outright. CI check 2 catches spec-diff escapes at
merge time whatever produced them.

The finer splits — `spec-author` not writing `src/`, `implementer` not writing the delta —
cannot be expressed: path-scoped permissions are session-wide, not per-agent, and the
per-agent hook that would express them is skipped unless the folder is explicitly trusted.
Those rows are convention, caught at review. The earlier claim that the matrix rather than
good intentions keeps agents honest holds for the source of truth and nothing else.
See ADR-0013.

### Context discipline

Every agent session starts from durable files, never from chat history. The conductor — the session talking to the human, running `/atlas` — hands a subagent a Story issue number and nothing else; the subagent reads `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, the change folder, and the relevant capability spec. The conductor itself holds no work context: it reads status, presents gates and spawns, and writes no delta, no test and no `src/`. When a session must end mid-Story, `/handoff` writes the continuation state into the change folder — not into a chat log, not into the issue. Sessions are deliberately short and single-purpose; a session that has drifted onto a second Story is a bug.

---

## 7. Parallelism, isolation, and the merge-time check

**Isolation.** One Story = one change folder = one branch = one git worktree. Change folders never collide, which is OpenSpec's own design claim. The single shared mutable resource is `openspec/specs/`, and it is touched exactly once per Story: the archive commit at Stage 8.

You start with **one concurrent Story**, where two changes cannot possibly race for the same spec file. Your review capacity, not agent wall-clock, is the constraint.

**The evidence for worktrees arrived on 2026-08-29 and they are no longer dormant.** Two agents were working in the one clone — one decomposing `FEAT: schedule` into Stories, one building tooling on a `chore/` branch — and the second found itself on a `story/` branch it had deleted, carrying its uncommitted work, because *two agents in one clone share `HEAD`*. A checkout by either moves the other's working tree underneath it and neither is told. Nothing was lost only because both branches pointed at the same commit. The rule is now **one agent per working tree**, with the exact commands and what does and does not carry over in `AGENTS.md` § *Working in parallel*.

Note what this does and does not fix. A worktree isolates `HEAD`, the index and the files; it does nothing about two Stories racing for one file in `openspec/specs/`, which is still decided at Stage 2 by the switch-back trigger below. Working-tree collision and spec collision are separate problems with separate answers, and having one answer is not having both.

**The switch-back trigger.** In-PR archiving is safe while concurrent Stories target *different* capabilities — different capabilities are different files, so git never sees a conflict. If two concurrent Stories ever target the **same** capability, either serialise them or move that pair to separate `archive/<change-id>` PRs landing after each story merges. Do not discover this at merge time: it is a decision made when the second Story is started, at Stage 2.

**The merge-time check.** CI on every PR:

1. `openspec validate --all --strict --no-interactive`
2. **Spec-diff containment** — every file changed under `openspec/specs/` must belong to a capability named in the archived change's delta. On a `chore/` branch the set must be empty. This is the check that makes the source of truth safe.
3. **Single-change rule** — a `story/` PR adds exactly one directory under `openspec/changes/archive/` and leaves no active change folder behind for that Story.
4. **Scenario coverage** — every `#### Scenario:` in the change's delta has an acceptance test whose title matches it verbatim. See §8.
5. **G4 approval recorded** — the Story issue carries a comment beginning `G4: approved`. This is what turns "no implementation before G4" from a convention into a red build.
6. **Commit hygiene** — no commit on the branch carries an attribution trailer or names a tool (§hard rule 7).
7. `pnpm run verify` — lint, typecheck, test.
8. `openspec validate --archived` — every `tasks.md` checkbox in the newly archived change is ticked.

Checks 2–6 are bespoke scripts in `scripts/`. They are the most likely part of this system to rot. `docs/retrospective.md` §3 scores whether they earned their keep after the first end-to-end Story: none has yet blocked a bad merge, check 3 is now first on the cut list, and check 4 justifies itself by pacing the red-green loop rather than by ever failing.

**Four of the eight are skipped while the PR is a draft** — 3, 4, 5 and 8, the ones that ask whether the Story is finished. The PR opens at Stage 4, before any code exists, so on the day it opens those four would fail by construction: nothing is archived, no scenario is covered, and G4 has not been given yet. Skipping them is what makes an early PR usable rather than a permanent red X you learn to ignore. Checks 1, 2, 6 and 7 run on every push from the first one, so a draft still proves the branch validates, stays inside its capabilities, keeps its commit history clean, and lints, typechecks and tests. `gh pr ready` at Stage 8 restores the full list, and the workflow subscribes to `ready_for_review` so that it actually runs then. ADR-1003 records what this gives up: a draft cannot be merged, so nothing those four guard can land while they are skipped, but a Story now learns about a coverage or containment failure when the draft is lifted rather than on every push. `pnpm run checks` locally is the earlier warning.

**Checks 3 and 4 are staged.** Run locally on a Story still in flight they report rather than fail — the single-change rule reads "still active" until the archive at Stage 8, and scenario coverage reports how many scenarios are covered and names the next one. Failing locally would demand every acceptance test at once, which is precisely the bulk transcription §8 forbids. In CI they bind, because a PR asserts the Story is finished.

**What check 5 can and cannot prove.** Agents act through the repository owner's token, so no check can prove a human rather than an agent wrote a comment. Check 5 proves the decision was *recorded*, which converts a silent omission into a blocked merge. The gate's integrity rests on agents never originating the marker — stated in `AGENTS.md` rule 1 and in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. ADR-0014 records why the marker is `G4: approved` and not the bare word.

> **What check 2 gives up.** The stricter form of this rule — "a story branch may never touch `openspec/specs/` at all" — is airtight and needs no script, but it forces archiving into a second PR. Containment is the weaker guarantee that survives one-PR archiving: it blocks unrelated or hand-edited spec changes, but cannot prove the diff is byte-for-byte what `/opsx:archive` would have produced. Accepted deliberately; recorded in ADR-0004.

**TDD enforcement, honestly.** Checks 4 and 5 prove tests exist, are named after scenarios, and pass. They do *not* prove a test was red before the implementation was written. Nothing short of commit-order forensics does, and that is defeated by one rebase. Red-before-green is therefore a **documented discipline in `AGENTS.md` and a PR checkbox you tick**, plus the `tdd` skill's own loop rules. This is a deliberate weakening of your requirement, recorded in ADR-0010.

## 8. Where the spec stops and the test starts

**Scenarios drive tests. They never generate them.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Acceptance tests** | One per `#### Scenario:` in the delta, at the top seam, **title identical to the scenario title**. Machine-checked at PR time. |
| **Unit tests** | Free-form, below the seam, not traced to anything, written as the TDD loop demands. |

The seam is agreed *before* any test is written, per the `tdd` skill — the fewer seams, the better, and existing seams beat new ones. The seam for a Story is named in its `design.md`.

**The tension this resolves:** a settled OpenSpec spec is, by construction, a complete set of behaviours imagined before any code — which is exactly what the `tdd` skill calls horizontal slicing and names an anti-pattern. The resolution is consumption order. The spec is written up front; the *tests are not*. Each red-green cycle picks up one not-yet-satisfied scenario, writes that one test, makes it pass, and moves on. The coverage lint only runs at PR time, when the change is finished — never per-commit — so it can never push you into writing tests in bulk.

## 9. Definition of Ready / Definition of Done

### DoR — a Story may enter Stage 5

- [ ] Sub-issue of exactly one Feature, which is a sub-issue of exactly one Epic
- [ ] Intent stated in one sentence
- [ ] Every blocking Story closed
- [ ] No open questions left by the grill
- [ ] Change folder exists; `openspec validate <change-id> --strict` exits 0
- [ ] Seam(s) named in `design.md`
- [ ] Draft PR open on the branch, rebased onto current `main`
- [ ] Human `approved` comment on the issue (**G4**)

**Who ticks a box.** Whoever can verify the condition: the orchestrator ticks G1 and G2, the implementer ticks the machine-checkable DoR and DoD boxes. Ticking asserts the condition holds, not that a human looked. The one line no agent may write is the G4 marker, which is a comment rather than a checkbox precisely so the two cannot be confused.

### DoD — a Story is finished

- [ ] Every scenario in the delta has a passing, name-matched acceptance test
- [ ] `pnpm run verify` green; full CI green
- [ ] PR rebased onto current `main` before the review, and out of draft after the archive
- [ ] `code-review` clean on both axes
- [ ] ADR written if a decision was hard, reversible-with-pain, or surprising
- [ ] `/opsx:archive` run as the last commit on the branch: `openspec/specs/` updated, change under `changes/archive/`, every `tasks.md` box ticked
- [ ] PR squash-merged into `main`; issue auto-closed
- [ ] Parents settled: the Feature closed if no open Story remains under it, and its Epic if no open Feature remains under that
- [ ] `docs/graph.mmd` regenerated, with no amber node left standing

## 10. Skill inventory

Installed as one pinned plugin from the official marketplace, and **not** pruned — because pruning turns out to be unnecessary.

Claude Code has no per-skill disable mechanism: `claude plugin disable` operates at plugin granularity, there is no `disabledSkills` setting, and deleting skill directories from the installed copy is reverted by `claude plugin update`. That would normally force a fork. It doesn't here, because every skill on the kill list already declares `disable-model-invocation: true` in its own frontmatter — `to-spec`, `implement`, `wayfinder`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, and in fact all the user-invoked skills. They cannot fire on their own; only an explicit invocation by name reaches them. The two we most want firing automatically, `tdd` and `code-review`, are the model-invocable ones.

So "disabled" below means **never invoke**, enforced by `AGENTS.md` and backed by the fact that nothing can invoke them accidentally. No fork, no vendoring, no upstream tracking.

| Skill | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `grill-with-docs` | **enabled** | Stage 3; also maintains `CONTEXT.md` |
| `to-tickets` | **enabled**, template overridden | Stage 2; issue bodies emit stubs, not acceptance criteria |
| `tdd` | **enabled** | Stages 5–6, invoked by `/opsx:apply` |
| `code-review` | **enabled** | Stage 7 |
| `triage` | **enabled** | label state machine for inbound work |
| `handoff` | **enabled** | context discipline, §6 |
| `diagnosing-bugs`, `research`, `domain-modeling`, `codebase-design`, `resolving-merge-conflicts` | enabled | narrow, no overlap |
| `to-spec` | **never invoke** | duplicates `/opsx:propose`; would publish requirements prose to the issue tracker, breaking §1 |
| `implement` | **never invoke** | duplicates `/opsx:apply`, and its "commit your work to the current branch" step bypasses G7/G8 |
| `wayfinder` | **never invoke** | multi-session decision tickets; premature at one concurrent Story |
| `improve-codebase-architecture` | **never invoke** | there is no codebase yet |
| `prototype`, `wizard`, `teach`, `to-questionnaire`, `wait-what`, `grill-me`, `ask-matt` | disabled | unused; keeps model-invoked surface small |

`setup-matt-pocock-skills` runs exactly once, in Phase 2, and configures tracker = GitHub, default triage labels, single-context docs.

## 11. ADR register

| ADR | Decision |
|---|---|
| 0001 | Monorepo: specs, docs, ADRs and code in one repo |
| 0002 | Systems of record: repo owns content, GitHub owns state; one-way traceability |
| 0003 | Epic → Feature → Story, and its mapping onto OpenSpec changes |
| 0004 | Branch-per-change isolation; archive inside the story PR, guarded by spec-diff containment |
| 0005 | Scenarios drive acceptance tests 1:1 by name; no code generation |
| 0006 | Model routing rule and the agent write-permission matrix |
| 0007 | Public repo in a free organisation; no LICENSE file |
| 0008 | Toolchain: Node 24 LTS, pnpm 11, TypeScript pinned to 5.9.3, Vitest 4 — and the platform-decision deferral point |
| 0009 | Skill inventory: which skills are never invoked, and why no disable mechanism is needed |
| 0010 | TDD enforced by convention plus PR-time coverage lint, not commit-order forensics |
| 0011 | Supply-chain quarantine: `minimumReleaseAge` set explicitly so pnpm fails on freshly-published versions rather than silently falling back |
| 0012 | No GitHub Project board; the gate checkboxes are the status |
| 0013 | The write-permission matrix is enforced in three layers, and only partly |
| 0014 | G4 is a relayed human decision, recorded as `G4: approved` and enforced at merge time |

All fourteen are written; `docs/adr/README.md` is the live index.

ADRs are immutable once accepted: the decision, its rationale and the alternatives it weighed never change. A reversal is a new ADR that supersedes the old one; the old file stays. Incidental detail that was simply wrong — a command, a version, a path — is corrected in place and logged in a dated `## Corrections` section, so the fix is visible rather than silent. `docs/adr/README.md` carries the rule and the test for which case you are in.

## 12. Is this proportionate?

Honestly: **it is at the ceiling of what one person at 4–8h/week can carry, and it is only worth it because of what you said "done" means.**

The gates cost you roughly 45–90 minutes of *your own* time per Story — reading a proposal and delta at G4, accepting a decomposition at G2, reading review findings at G7. If a Story is three hours of agent work, that is a 25–50% tax. You are buying: specs that stay true, a cold agent that needs no explanation, and decisions you can still reconstruct in a year. That is a good trade *if and only if the tax amortises* — which means:

**A Story smaller than roughly two hours of work must not go through the full pipeline.** Batch it into a larger change, or route it through `chore/`. The single fastest way to make this apparatus feel absurd is to run a five-line fix through ten stages.

*One exception:* a Story whose purpose is to exercise the pipeline itself — a scaffolding dry run, or a rehearsal after the process changes materially. There the trivial size is the point, because the work must not distract from the machinery being tested. Say so in the Story's intent. Absent that sentence, this rule stands and a cold agent should push back on the assignment rather than proceed.

### If it hurts, cut in this order

1. **Fold Stage 3 into Stage 4** — grill inside `/opsx:propose` rather than as a separate session. Cheapest cut, smallest loss.
2. **Fold Stage 7 into Stage 8** — review as a PR step rather than a separate agent pass.
3. **Drop the Epic level** — keep Feature → Story. Epics are the layer with no disk anchor and therefore the first fiction to appear.
4. **Drop CI checks 3 and 4** — keep spec-diff containment (check 2), which is the one that actually protects the source of truth.

What you should not cut, in any version: **G4** and **CI check 2**. Those two are the process. Everything else is scaffolding around them.

### Already cut, before we started

The first draft of this document put the archive step in a second PR on `main`, landing after the story PR merged. That is the airtight option and it is what OpenSpec recommends for teams. It was cut because it doubles the PR count to defend against a collision that cannot occur at one concurrent Story and is rare at three. §7 records the trigger for putting it back.

**It has been revisited.** `docs/retrospective.md` §6 scores this list against the first
end-to-end Story: the order changed, the two never-cut items did not. Read that before acting
on the list above.
