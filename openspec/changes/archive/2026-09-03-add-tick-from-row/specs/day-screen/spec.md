## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A row offers the tick that keeps its commitment, and refuses one for a day that has not arrived

A row SHALL offer, when asked as of a calendar date, either exactly one tick or nothing at all. The
tick it offers SHALL be the tick of that row's commitment on the date the day view holding it is of,
and nothing else: the row is a commitment on a date and a tick is a commitment on a date, so there
is nothing left for a caller to supply and nothing for the row to choose.

The row SHALL offer nothing exactly when the day view's date is later than the day it is asked as
of, and the tick otherwise. A row asked as of its own date SHALL offer the tick — a day that has
arrived can have been kept, and only one that has not is refused — and so SHALL a row whose date is
earlier, however much earlier: the past is writable back to the day the commitment is kept from, and
a commitment that is not due there has no row to ask.

The day the row is asked as of SHALL be given to it, and this capability MUST NOT read it from a
clock, MUST NOT consult the present moment, the device's time zone or the locale, and MUST NOT keep
it. A row therefore answers the same way for ever when asked as of the same day, and a row asked
twice as of two different days answers each on its own — an app left open past midnight refuses on
last night's reckoning for no longer than the question it is asked, because the day arrives with the
question rather than with the day view.

The tick a row offers SHALL be the tick that makes its commitment kept on that date, and the same
tick SHALL be the one that takes it back. Adding it to the history the day view was formed from
makes a day view formed again from that history say the row is kept; taking it back makes a day view
formed again say it is not. The row SHALL NOT add or take back anything itself, and MUST NOT hold,
copy or alter a history: what a record is, where it is held and what happens when one is added twice
are the `record` capability's answers, and this capability adds nothing to them.

A row SHALL offer the same tick whether or not it says its commitment is already kept. The tick is
made of the commitment and the date, and neither of those is what a history says, so the row's
answer depends on the day it is asked as of and on nothing else. A row whose date is later than the
day it is asked as of SHALL therefore offer nothing whether or not it says the commitment is kept:
the refusal is about a day that has not arrived, not about what is recorded on it, and a row that
could be untapped but not tapped would be two rules where the product has one.

A row SHALL refuse for no other reason. A row exists only for a commitment that is due on the day
view's date, and being due on the date is the whole of what makes a tick formable, so the only row
that offers nothing is one asked as of a day earlier than its own.

#### Scenario: a row offers the tick for its commitment on the date the day view is of

- **WHEN** a day view is formed on Monday 31 August 2026, from a history that has taken no tick, of
  a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January
  2026, and its one row is asked as of Monday 31 August 2026
- **THEN** the row offers a tick
- **AND** that tick is the same tick as one formed directly for that commitment on Monday 31 August
  2026

#### Scenario: adding the tick a row offers makes a day view formed again say the commitment is kept

- **WHEN** a day view is formed on Monday 31 August 2026, from a history that has taken no tick, of
  a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January
  2026; its one row is asked as of that same day; and the tick it offers is added to that history
- **THEN** a day view formed again on Monday 31 August 2026, of the same commitment and from the
  history as it now stands, holds one row named "Gym" saying the commitment is kept

#### Scenario: taking back the tick a row offers makes a day view formed again say the commitment is not kept

- **WHEN** a day view is formed on Monday 31 August 2026, of a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule
  listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January 2026, from a history holding a tick
  for that commitment on that date; its one row is asked as of that same day; and the tick it offers
  is taken back from that history
- **THEN** that row says the commitment is kept
- **AND** a day view formed again on Monday 31 August 2026, of the same commitment and from the
  history as it now stands, holds one row named "Gym" saying the commitment is not kept

#### Scenario: a row already saying the commitment is kept offers the same tick

- **WHEN** two day views are formed on Monday 31 August 2026, each of a commitment named "Gym" on a
  schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January 2026, the first from a
  history that has taken no tick and the second from a history holding a tick for that commitment on
  that date, and each one's row is asked as of that same day
- **THEN** the first row says the commitment is not kept and the second says it is
- **AND** both offer the same tick

#### Scenario: a row for a date later than the day it is asked as of offers no tick

- **WHEN** a day view is formed on Wednesday 2 September 2026, from a history that has taken no
  tick, of a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from
  1 January 2026, and its one row is asked as of Monday 31 August 2026
- **THEN** the day view holds one row named "Gym"
- **AND** that row offers no tick

#### Scenario: a row for a date earlier than the day it is asked as of offers the tick

- **WHEN** a day view is formed on Monday 31 August 2026, from a history that has taken no tick, of
  a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January
  2026, and its one row is asked as of Saturday 5 September 2026
- **THEN** the row offers a tick
- **AND** that tick is the same tick as one formed directly for that commitment on Monday 31 August
  2026

#### Scenario: a row for a date later than the day it is asked as of offers no tick even where it says the commitment is kept

- **WHEN** a day view is formed on Saturday 5 September 2026, of a commitment named "Gym" on a
  schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January 2026, from a history holding
  a tick for that commitment on that date, and its one row is asked as of Monday 31 August 2026
- **THEN** that row says the commitment is kept
- **AND** it offers no tick

#### Scenario: a row's answer follows the day it is asked as of rather than the day the day view was formed

- **WHEN** a day view is formed on Wednesday 2 September 2026, from a history that has taken no
  tick, of a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from
  1 January 2026, and its one row is asked twice — once as of Tuesday 1 September 2026 and once as
  of Wednesday 2 September 2026
- **THEN** the first asking offers no tick
- **AND** the second offers the tick for that commitment on Wednesday 2 September 2026

#### Scenario: a row offers the tick in the first supported year and in the last

- **WHEN** a day view is formed on Monday 3 January 1583, from a history that has taken no tick, of
  a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January
  1583, and its one row is asked as of Monday 3 January 1583
- **THEN** the row offers a tick
- **AND** the row of a day view of the same commitment and history on Monday 27 December 9999, asked
  as of Monday 27 December 9999, offers a tick
- **AND** that same row, asked as of Monday 3 January 1583, offers none

#### Scenario: every row of a day view whose date has not arrived offers no tick

- **WHEN** a day view is formed on Wednesday 2 September 2026, from a history that has taken no
  tick, of a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, then one
  named "Vitamins" on a schedule listing all seven weekdays, then one named "Reading" on a weekly
  quota of 3 times a week, all three kept from 1 January 2026, and every one of its rows is asked as
  of Monday 31 August 2026
- **THEN** the day view holds three rows, named "Gym", "Vitamins" and "Reading"
- **AND** none of them offers a tick

#### Scenario: a row for a commitment on a weekly quota offers a tick even where its quota is already met

- **WHEN** a day view is formed on Sunday 6 September 2026, of a commitment named "Reading" on a
  weekly quota of 3 times a week, kept from 1 January 2026, from a history holding ticks for that
  commitment on Monday 31 August, Wednesday 2 September and Saturday 5 September 2026, and its one
  row is asked as of Sunday 6 September 2026
- **THEN** the day view holds one row named "Reading", saying the commitment is not kept
- **AND** that row offers a tick

### Requirement: A row is a commitment's line on a date

A row SHALL be three things and no others: the commitment it is a line for, the date the day view
holding it is of, and whether that commitment is kept on that date. Two rows SHALL be the same row
when all three agree, and SHALL be different when any one of them differs.

The date is part of what a row is rather than something the day view alone holds. Two rows for the
same commitment, each saying the same thing about it, on two different dates SHALL be different
rows: they offer different ticks, and one cannot stand in for the other. This adds to what a day
view is without changing it — a day view is already its rows and its date, so day views on two dates
were already two day views, and this makes them so a second way rather than a new way.

A row SHALL be reachable only through the day view that holds it, and SHALL give back only its
commitment's name, whether that commitment is kept, and the tick it offers. It MUST NOT give back
the commitment itself, the schedule underneath it, the day it is kept from, or the date the row is
for: what a reader is given is what a screen draws and what a tap makes, and nothing else has been
asked for.

#### Scenario: two rows for the same commitment and date saying the same thing are the same row

- **WHEN** two day views are formed on Monday 31 August 2026, each of a commitment named "Gym" on a
  schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January 2026, each from a history
  holding a tick for that commitment on that date
- **THEN** each holds one row saying the commitment is kept
- **AND** the two rows are the same row

#### Scenario: two rows for the same commitment on different dates are different rows

- **WHEN** two day views are formed of a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday,
  Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January 2026, each from a history that has taken no tick, one
  on Monday 31 August 2026 and one on Wednesday 2 September 2026
- **THEN** each holds one row named "Gym", saying the commitment is not kept
- **AND** the two rows are different rows

#### Scenario: two rows for the same commitment and date differing in whether it is kept are different rows

- **WHEN** two day views are formed on Monday 31 August 2026, each of a commitment named "Gym" on a
  schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January 2026, the first from a
  history that has taken no tick and the second from a history holding a tick for that commitment on
  that date
- **THEN** the two rows are different rows
