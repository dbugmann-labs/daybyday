## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A store keeps a history at a place, across the app being closed and opened again

A store SHALL be opened at a place, and SHALL hold a history: every tick added to it and not since
taken back. Opening a store at a place where nothing has been kept SHALL give an empty history
rather than an error — that is what the first launch looks like, and it is the only time a store
opens empty.

A tick added to a store SHALL be kept at that place before the store reports it added, so that a
store opened at the same place afterwards — by the app opened again, or by anything else, and
whether or not the first store was ever closed — holds it. There is no separate step at which a
store is saved: the app can be stopped at any moment without warning, and a tick waiting to be saved
would be exactly the record the product promises not to lose. Taking a tick back SHALL be kept the
same way. A store that cannot keep a change MUST refuse it and MUST NOT hold it: the history a store
reports is never ahead of what is kept at its place.

A store SHALL persist a tick as exactly what a tick is — its commitment, with the name, the schedule
and the kept-from day that commitment is made of, and its calendar date — and nothing else. A tick
read back SHALL be the same tick that was added, for every schedule shape, for any name a
commitment can have, and for any date the system supports. The store MUST NOT key a tick to the
moment it was entered, and MUST NOT pass a calendar date through an instant, a time zone or a locale
on the way in or out. A store holds at most one tick per commitment per day, as a history does, and
two stores at different places SHALL be independent of each other.

#### Scenario: a store opened where nothing has been kept holds an empty history

- **WHEN** a store is opened at a place where no store has ever been kept
- **THEN** it opens without error
- **AND** its history is the same as a history that has taken no tick

#### Scenario: a tick added to a store is held by a second store opened at the same place while the first is still open

- **WHEN** a tick for a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday,
  kept from 1 January 2026, on Monday 31 August 2026 is added to a store, and a second store is then
  opened at the same place with the first still open and nothing else done to it
- **THEN** the second store's history answers that the commitment was kept on Monday 31 August 2026

#### Scenario: a tick taken back is not held by a store opened afterwards at the same place

- **WHEN** a tick for a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday,
  kept from 1 January 2026, on Monday 31 August 2026 is added to a store and then taken back, and a
  store is opened afterwards at the same place
- **THEN** the later store's history answers that the commitment was not kept on Monday 31 August
  2026
- **AND** its history is the same as a history that has taken no tick

#### Scenario: a store opened again holds exactly the ticks added and not taken back

- **WHEN** ticks are added to a store for a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday,
  Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January 2026, on Monday 31 August, Wednesday 2 September and
  Saturday 5 September 2026, and for a commitment named "Run" on the same schedule and kept from the
  same day on Monday 31 August 2026; the tick for "Gym" on 2 September is taken back; and a store is
  opened afterwards at the same place
- **THEN** the later store's history is the same as a history to which exactly the three remaining
  ticks were added

#### Scenario: adding a tick the store already holds leaves what is kept unchanged

- **WHEN** the same tick — a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and
  Saturday, kept from 1 January 2026, on Monday 31 August 2026 — is added to a store twice, and a
  store is opened afterwards at the same place
- **THEN** the later store's history is the same as a history that tick was added to once

#### Scenario: ticks of commitments on every schedule shape are read back as the same ticks

- **WHEN** ticks are added to a store for one commitment on each schedule shape the system has — a
  commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from 1 January
  2026, on Monday 31 August 2026; a commitment named "Finances" on a schedule on the 25th of the
  month, kept from 1 January 2026, on 25 September 2026; a commitment named "Plants" on a schedule
  of every 3 days starting on 25 August 2026, kept from 1 September 2026, on 3 September 2026; and a
  commitment named "Reading" on a weekly quota of 3 times a week, kept from 1 January 2026, on
  Monday 7 September 2026 — and a store is opened afterwards at the same place
- **THEN** the later store's history is the same as a history to which those same ticks were added
- **AND** it answers that each of the four commitments was kept on its date

#### Scenario: a commitment name is read back exactly, whatever it contains

- **WHEN** a tick is added to a store for a commitment whose name is "Zürich — „langer“ Lauf 🏃" followed
  by a line break and the word "Sonntags", on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept
  from 1 January 2026, on Monday 31 August 2026, and a store is opened afterwards at the same place
- **THEN** the later store's history answers that a commitment with exactly that name, schedule and
  kept-from day was kept on Monday 31 August 2026
- **AND** its history is the same as a history that tick was added to

#### Scenario: a tick in the first supported year and one in the last are read back unchanged

- **WHEN** ticks are added to a store for a commitment on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and
  Saturday, kept from 1 January 1583, on Monday 3 January 1583 and on Monday 27 December 9999, and a
  store is opened afterwards at the same place
- **THEN** the later store's history answers that the commitment was kept on both dates
- **AND** its history is the same as a history those two ticks were added to

#### Scenario: stores at different places hold different histories

- **WHEN** a tick for a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday,
  kept from 1 January 2026, on Monday 31 August 2026 is added to a store at one place, and a store
  is opened at a different place where nothing has been kept
- **THEN** the second store's history is the same as a history that has taken no tick
- **AND** a store opened afterwards at the first place answers that the commitment was kept on
  Monday 31 August 2026

#### Scenario: a tick that cannot be kept is refused and not held

- **WHEN** a store is opened at a place where nothing can be written — a path beneath an existing
  ordinary file — and a tick for a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and
  Saturday, kept from 1 January 2026, on Monday 31 August 2026 is added to it
- **THEN** adding the tick is refused with an error
- **AND** the store's history is still the same as a history that has taken no tick
- **AND** a store opened afterwards at the same place holds an empty history

### Requirement: A store that cannot be read is refused rather than emptied

Opening a store at a place that holds something this app cannot read as a store SHALL be refused
with an error. The store MUST NOT answer with an empty history in its place, MUST NOT overwrite,
move or delete what is there, and MUST NOT keep the part of it that could be read: the whole is
refused, so that whatever is at that place is still there, unchanged, for a person or a later
version of the app to recover. An honest error on opening is the failure the product can survive;
a record silently replaced by an empty one is the failure it exists to remove.

Three things this app cannot read as a store: content that is not a store at all; a store written
in a form later than the one this app knows, which a later version of the app may have left behind;
and a store holding something that could not be a tick — a date that names no day, or a commitment
on a date it is not due on — because a tick that could not be formed is not one this app wrote.

#### Scenario: content that is not a store is refused and left as it was

- **WHEN** a store is opened at a place holding content that is not a store — a run of bytes that
  is not what the store writes
- **THEN** opening is refused with an error
- **AND** the content at that place is byte-for-byte what it was before

#### Scenario: a store written in a later form than this app knows is refused

- **WHEN** a store is opened at a place holding a store written in a form one later than the form
  this app writes, holding no ticks
- **THEN** opening is refused with an error
- **AND** the content at that place is byte-for-byte what it was before

#### Scenario: a store holding what could not be a tick is refused

- **WHEN** a store is opened at a place holding a store in the form this app writes, whose one tick
  is of a commitment named "Gym" on a schedule listing Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, kept from
  1 January 2026, on Tuesday 1 September 2026 — a date the commitment is not due on
- **THEN** opening is refused with an error
- **AND** a store at a place holding one tick on 30 February 2026, a date that names no day, is
  refused the same way
- **AND** the content at each place is byte-for-byte what it was before
